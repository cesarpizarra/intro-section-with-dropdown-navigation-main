# Frontend Mentor - Intro Section with Dropdown Navigation Challenge Solution


This repository contains my solution to the "Intro Section with Dropdown Navigation" coding challenge from Frontend Mentor. The challenge aimed to improve a dropdown menu design. I implemented the solution using React.js, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Challenge Description

The challenge was to create a dropdown navigation menu that provides an improved user experience. The goal was to implement the design provided by Frontend Mentor and make the dropdown functional and responsive.


## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Vite: A fast build tooling framework for modern web projects.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

## Solution Overview

The project is bootstrapped using Vite, a fast and opinionated build tool for modern web applications. React is used as the JavaScript library for building the user interface. Tailwind CSS is utilized for styling and creating responsive layouts. Components are created using React's functional component syntax, and Tailwind CSS classes are used to apply styles to the components. The project follows a component-based architecture for better organization and reusability. CSS modules or CSS-in-JS libraries can be used to scope styles within the components.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor.
3. Install the project dependencies by running the following command in the project directory:
